A Cardano grille is made from a sheet of fairly rigid paper or parchment, or from thin metal.The paper is ruled
to represent lines of handwriting and rectangular areas are cut out at arbitrary intervals between these lines.
An encipherer places the grille on a sheet of paper and writes his message in the rectangular apertures, some of
which might allow a single letter, a syllable, or a whole word. Then, removing the grille, the fragments are
filled out to create a note or letter that disguises the true message. Cardano suggested drafting the text three
times in order to smooth any irregularities that might indicate the hidden words.
The recipient of the message must possess an identical grille. Copies of grilles are cut from an original template,
but many different patterns could be made for one-to-one correspondence.
The grille can be placed in four positions - face up and face down, upright and reversed â€“ which increases the
number of possible cell positions fourfold.
